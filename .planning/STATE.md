## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Incorporate existing repo via full-history merge — preserves provenance
- [Init]: `godoo` package → `godoo-client` on PyPI; other package names unchanged
- [Init]: v1 scope = SEED §2 parity gaps + adjacent bugs in the same files (FIXES-01/02/03)
- [Init]: Phases 2 and 3 may run in parallel after Phase 1 completes (packages are independent)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Init]: `godoo-introspection` is currently an empty placeholder package — Phase 2 builds it from scratch
- [Init]: PyPI package rename (`godoo` → `godoo-client`) is a breaking change; RELEASE-02 must handle migration docs/deprecation notice

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Compatibility | COMPAT-01: Relax Python floor to 3.11/3.12 | Deferred to post-v1 | Init |
| Client | CLIENT-V2-01: Auto re-auth on session expiry | Deferred to v2 | Init |
| Performance | PERF-01: `read_group` SUM for cash balance | Deferred to backlog | Init |
| Performance | PERF-02: CDC two-round-trip optimization | Deferred to backlog | Init |
